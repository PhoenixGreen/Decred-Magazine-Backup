# Decred-Magazine-Backup
 The main backup for Decred Magazine

## How to install Ghost Locally and rebuild Decred Magazine
Install new build in an empty folder - https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/

## Required Files and Folders after building a local version:

* Content Folder – Has all the images and documents for individual posts and pages
* decred-magazine....json file – Needs to be imported in the settings area to populate all the posts. This file can be found in the content folder.

* Ghost theme "Headlines" – Needs to be activated in the theme settings area


After building, I've noticed that some design elements in the header and footer need resetting up, 
but if you experience any issues, give me a shout and I can point you in the right direction.

SIDE-NOTE: I will periodically update the json file and the content folder with all the new posts, but this will 
likely mess up any substantial post editing you may have done, e.g., translated posts. Before importing the new 
json file export the old one just incase.

The content folder should be fine unless you replace the old folder with the new one. In which case you would likely
lose any edits or content you've added.

This backup is predominantly meant for the longevity of the Decred Magazine project, but I have no issues with anyone 
using the build for their own ideas and implementations. Enjoy!
